Framework for computational screening of candidate materials for superconductivity by evaluating electronic band flatness near the Fermi level

* Extend Xie et al.'s crystal graph convolutional neural network to accept multi-scale (both elemental and structural) features as network inputs 
* Query Materials Project for electronic structure data
* Quantitatively characterize band "flatness" within a specified energy range of the Fermi level
